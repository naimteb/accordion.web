<!-- Landing page for a business selling accordions.

Should include a navbar at the top
and a landing page with a button, text and image
and then 3 sections under that next to each other horizontally, containing some business values and pillars.
Finally, a contact us section, where there is an email input, a text input, and a send button

Also add a footer in the end  -->

            V-Accordions have revolutionized the music world, and Roland has
            dedicated itself to the ongoing development of these amazing
            instruments. The FR-1x series is the newest addition to the famous
            V-Accordion family. These compact, lightweight models offer the same
            flexibility and portability as their popular FR-1 predecessors, but
            add significant features, including USB functionality and advanced
            bellows-pressure circuitry for enhanced sensitivity and precision.
            With new-generation speakers onboard and an expanded
            7-segment/3-character display, the FR-1x piano-type and FR-1xb
            button-type set a powerful standard for a small lightweight
            accordion.
